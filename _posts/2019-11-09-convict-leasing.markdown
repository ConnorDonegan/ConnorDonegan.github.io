title: "Florida's convict leasing program (1877-1919)"
---

Under the State of Florida’s convict leasing program (1877-1919) over 10,000 Floridians and visitors served sentences of hard labor at the pain of the lash. Prisoners labored in some of Florida’s first phosphate mines and were leased to turpentine and lumber operations throughout the state. This article draws on over four decades of reports on the prison system by the Florida Department of Agriculture, including geographic sentencing data, data on prisoner characteristics, minutes from the Board of Pardons and additional materials held in the Convict Lease Subject Files in the Florida State Archives.

The article relates homicidal violence against prisoners and the Federal Judiciary's formal refusal to enforce due process rights---rendering black Americans and others vulnerable to state-sanctioned violence at all times---to the proliferation of debt peonage and wage stagnation in what were then Florida's largest industries, lumber and turpentine.

While certain demographic groups (e.g. white women) were spared the indignities of prison labor, this research exposes that persons with disabilities, white and black, were disproportionately sentenced to state prison. In official reports and professional conferences, Florida prison officials aped the latest pseudo-scientific theories of race and social fitness to naturalize the prevalence of death and disability among prisoners in their custody. In response to repeated attempts to abolish the system, officials aimed to recast the palpably barbaric institution as particularly suitable for the purpose of repressing the state’s increasingly non-agricultural black working class, dubbed the "criminal class."
