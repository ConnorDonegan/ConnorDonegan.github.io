I'm currently a doctoral student in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at the University of Texas at Dallas and a research assistant in Population and Data Sciences at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. I'm a geographer with graduate training from the qualitative and quantitative sides of the discipline. Other experiences informing my work include working as a data scientist and as a statistical consultant with psychologists from the College Transition Collaborative of Stanford University.

My research at UTDallas is concerned with methodological developments in spatial statistics and generally involves the application of Bayesian probability theory and computational techniques to spatial filtering methods for regression and disease mapping. My work at UTSouthwestern, with Dr. Amy Hughes, involves application of GIS technology, spatial algorithms and spatial data analysis to questions in population health such as the social determinants of food insecurity and identifying optimal siting for a mobile mammography clinic that provides free mammograms to women in the greater DFW area.

While at UBC my work centered on social and economic inequality and political economy. My thesis on convict leasing in Florida is published in *Florida Historical Quarterly.* 

The source code and data for most of my research is available on my [github](https://github.com/ConnorDonegan?tab=repositories) page.
