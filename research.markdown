This project proposes and evaluates a Bayesian method for spatial regression using eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) and Piironen and Vehtari’s (2017) regularized horseshoe (RHS) prior. A demonstration analysis of 2016 U.S. Presidential election results in Ohio further highlights the advantages of estimating spatial models using the Stan probabilistic programming language.

Under the State of Florida’s convict leasing program (1877-1919) over 10,000 Floridians and visitors served sentences of hard labor at the pain of the lash. This project draws on over four decades of reports on the prison system by the Florida Department of Agriculture, including geographic sentencing data, data on prisoner characteristics, minutes from the Board of Pardons and additional materials held in the Convict Lease Subject Files in the Florida State Archives.

We identified overlapping geographic clusters of food insecurity and health across U.S. counties to identify potential shared mechanisms for geographic disparities in health and food insecurity. Generally consistent patterns in spatial overlaps between food security and health indicate potential for shared causal mechanisms. Identified regions and county-level characteristics associated with being located inside of overlapping clusters may be used in future place-based intervention and policy.
