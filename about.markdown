I'm a doctoral student in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at the University of Texas at Dallas and Population and Data Sciences at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 

I study Bayesian inference and cancer epidemiology with my advisors Yongwan Chun and Amy Hughes. My dissertation project investigates the potential for georeferenced cancer surveillance data to inform geographically targeted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs to address spatial and racial inequalities in CRC incidence.

While at UBC I studied political economy and inequality; my research on convict leasing can be found in <em>Florida Historical Quarterly.</em>
