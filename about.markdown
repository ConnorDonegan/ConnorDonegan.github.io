I'm a doctoral student in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at the University of Texas at Dallas and Population and Data Sciences at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 

I study Bayesian inference and cancer epidemiology with my advisors Yongwan Chun and Amy Hughes. My dissertation research investigates if and, if so, how exactly georeferenced cancer surveillance data may be used for targeted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs to contribute to the elimination of spatial and racial inequalities in CRC incidence.

While at UBC my work centered on socio-economic inequality and political economy. Research from my thesis on convict leasing in Florida can be found in <em>Florida Historical Quarterly.</em>

The source code and data for most of my research is available on my [github](https://github.com/ConnorDonegan?tab=repositories) page.
