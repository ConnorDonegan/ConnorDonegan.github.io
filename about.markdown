I'm currently a doctoral student in Geospatial Information Sciences (GISc) at the University of Texas at Dallas and a research assistant in Population and Data Sciences at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. I'm a health geographer with graduate training from the qualitative and quantitative sides of the discipline. Other experiences informing my work include working as a data scientist and as a statistical consultant for psychologists at the College Transition Collaborative.

My research at UTDallas is mainly concerned with methodological developments in spatial statistics with my advisor Yongwan Chun and involves the application of Bayesian probability theory and computational techniques to spatial filtering methods for regression and disease mapping. My work at UTSouthwestern, with my (other) advisor Amy Hughes, involves application of GIS technology, spatial algorithms and spatial statistics to questions in population health including a study of young-onset colorectal cancer incidence and identifying optimal siting for a mobile mammography clinic that provides free mammograms to women in the greater DFW area.

While at UBC my work centered on socio-economic inequality and political economy. Research from my thesis on convict leasing in Florida can be found in *Florida Historical Quarterly.* 

The source code and data for most of my research is available on my [github](https://github.com/ConnorDonegan?tab=repositories) page.
