I am a doctoral student in Geospatial Information Sciences (GIS) at the University of Texas at Dallas and research assistant in Population and Data Sciences at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 

I study Bayesian inference, spatial statistics and epidemiology with my advisors Yongwan Chun and Amy Hughes. My dissertation project investigates the potential for georeferenced cancer surveillance data to inform geographically targeted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs to address spatial and racial inequalities in CRC incidence. As a masters student in geography at the University of British Columbia I studied political economy and racial inequality.
